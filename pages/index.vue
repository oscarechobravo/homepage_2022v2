        <h2>Systems and practice change at fractals co-op</h2>
        <p>fractals started when 4 friends got together to help achieve social impacts by guiding organisations and communities through processes that help them challenge the systems and practices. Broadly speaking we work with any organisation who is values aligned and wants to improve themselves, their products/services, or help communities achieve change. Often digital technology is at the core of this work, but it doesn't have to be.

        <h2>Research at Lancaster University</h2>
        <p>
          Oliver blends methods from <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/people-profiles/oliver-bates">user research, design, and data science</a>&nbsp;at Lancaster University across three broad areas:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>projects where data can help stakeholders champion carbon reductions</li>
            <li>critiquing digital technology where it is implicated in environmental or social injustice</li>
            <li>The co-design and development of tech focusing on doing good for people and the environment</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>From Computer Science to Championing Social Justice...</h3>

        <p>I specialise in research projects that bring together human-factors, with social and environmental injustice. Whilst I have qualifications what I love doing is bringing together people and methods that are appropriate for making social and environmental change where digital tech is involved.  I like to use a wide range of methods, often adapting, chopping, changing, and remixing them to fit the projects on which I work.</p>

        <h2>Data, Dashboards, and Organisational Tech at Cetis LLP</h2>
        <p>I joined Cetis in 2018 looking to bring my user research and communication skills out of academia and into industry. Cetis is a partnership and co-operative that historically has worked on learning technologies and EduTech.</p>
